GMM with EM, CAVI, Gibbs Sampling in iris dataset

In this repository, I have implemented GMM with EM(expectation maximization algorithm), CAVI(Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference), and Gibbs sampling.

To evaluate the efficiency and accuracy, I used the rand-index for clustering models. And also I compared each model's log-likelihood by cross-validation.
